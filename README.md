# ðŸŒ² Sequoia.nvim

A beautiful and versatile Neovim theme with three distinct modes, designed to match your mood and lightingâ€”whether you're coding in the sunlight, the twilight, or the dead of night.

## âœ¨ Theme Variants

- **ðŸŒ¿ Sequoia**  
  Inspired by JetBrains Fleet. A professional, vibrant, and colorful theme for daily use.

- **ðŸŒ² Sequoia Night**  
  A dark, subdued palette perfect for late-night sessions when everything else feels too bright. Ideal for 3AM focus.

- **ðŸŽ† Sequoia Insomnia**  
	A harsh, black theme with bright neon colors. This is what my experience with Insomnia has felt like.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "forest-nvim/sequoia.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    vim.cmd("colorscheme sequoia") -- or 'sequoia-night' / 'sequoia-rise'
  end
}
```

To switch between variants, simply change the name passed to `:colorscheme`, for example:

```vim
:colorscheme sequoia-night
```
