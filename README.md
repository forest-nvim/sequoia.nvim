# ðŸŒ² Sequoia.nvim

A Neovim theme with three modes!

Sequoia -> Similar to Jetbrains Fleet, a nice, professional and colorful theme for daily use
Sequoia Night -> A dark, and faded theme for when all other themes get to be too bright for your eyes. Perfect for 3am work.
Sequoia Rise -> A nice, warm theme inspired by the sunrise.
